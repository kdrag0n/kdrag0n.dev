This document details how you may use this website, related properties, and content. Please read it carefully before using our services, along with the [Privacy Policy]({{< relref "privacy-policy" >}}). If you do not fully understand and agree to both this document ("Terms of Service") and the Privacy Policy, you may not use any of our services. We may also refer to this document as the End-User License Agreement.

The terms in this document apply to the following properties:

- [kdrag0n.dev](https://kdrag0n.dev/)
- [protonaosp.kdrag0n.dev](https://protonaosp.kdrag0n.dev/)
- [patreon.kdrag0n.dev](https://patreon.kdrag0n.dev/)

All content on this website and related properties is provided on an as-is basis without warranty of any kind. By using our services, you agree that we are not liable for any potential harm, damages, or other negative effects resulting from your use of our services. Use our services at your own risk.

We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.

## Exclusive content

If you download exclusive content from [patreon.kdrag0n.dev](https://patreon.kdrag0n.dev/), you are granted a single license to the software for personal use only. **This license is non-transferable and non-exclusive; you may not share your license of the exclusive content with other users under any circumstances.** You may, however, purchase multiple licenses that can be shared with others on a per-individual basis. In such cases, this agreement applies independently to each individual.

"Exclusive content" is defined as **any** file downloaded from [patreon.kdrag0n.dev](https://patreon.kdrag0n.dev/). As a result, this section applies to all such files regardless of the method through which you obtained the files from the server. This includes, but is not limited to, the following methods: Patreon pledge benefits, one-time Stripe purchases, free trials, and other official promotions where content is distributed free of charge for any reason.

If you have multiple personal devices, you may use the software on all of them, as long as they are all **personal devices** â€” that is, you must physically own the devices and use them in a personal capacity. Sharing the content for other individuals to use on their own devices does not qualify and is considered a violation of these terms.

You may not redistribute, resell, sublicense, modify, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter exclusive software. This agreement will terminate immediately if we become aware of such actions from you.

You are not assigned any ownership of the content or intellectual property and may only use the content in accordance with these terms.

Please note that you are responsible for any and all actions occurring under your account.

## Termination

If you violate any provisions in this document, this agreement will be void immediately and you may not continue to use our services. We reserve the right to enforce this by revoking access to our services and disabling downloaded software at our discretion.

Our failure to enforce any portion of this agreement does not constitute a waiver.

## Updates

We reserve the right to update these terms at any time without notice. If significant changes are made, we will make an attempt to inform active users of affected services based on stored email addresses, but notification is not guaranteed.
