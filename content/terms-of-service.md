## Google Play Store

If you download our applications ("Play Store applications") from the Google Play Store, you are granted a single license to the software for personal use only. **This license is non-transferable and non-exclusive; you may not share your license for any of our applications with other users under any circumstances.** You may, however, purchase multiple licenses that can be shared with others on a per-individual basis. In such cases, this agreement applies independently to each individual.

"Play Store applications" is defined as **any** application by "kdrag0n" downloaded from the Google Play Store. This applies regardless of how you obtained the application and whether you paid a monetary fee for the application. For example, if you were granted a license to the application free of charge through an official promotion, all of these terms still apply.

If you have multiple personal devices, you may use the software on all of them, as long as they are all **personal devices** — that is, you must physically own the devices and use them in a personal capacity. Sharing the content for other individuals to use on their own devices does not qualify and is considered a violation of these terms.

You may not redistribute, resell, sublicense, modify, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter exclusive software. This agreement will terminate immediately if we become aware of such actions from you.

You are not assigned any ownership of the content or intellectual property and may only use the content in accordance with these terms.

Please note that you are responsible for any and all actions occurring under your account.

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE

In such cases, this agreement applies independently to each individual.

"Exclusive content" is defined as **any** file downloaded from [patreon.kdrag0n.dev](https://patreon.kdrag0n.dev/). As a result, this section applies to all such files regardless of the method through which you obtained the files from the server. This includes, but is not limited to, the following methods: Patreon pledge benefits, one-time Stripe purchases, free trials, and other official promotions where content is distributed free of charge for any reason.

If you have multiple personal devices, you may use the software on all of them, as long as they are all **personal devices** — that is, you must physically own the devices and use them in a personal capacity.

You may not redistribute, resell, sublicense, modify, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter exclusive software. This agreement will terminate immediately if we become aware of such actions from you.

You are not assigned any ownership of the content or intellectual property and may only use the content in accordance with these terms.
