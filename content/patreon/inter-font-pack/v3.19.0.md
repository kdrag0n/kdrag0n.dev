### Buy

You can get early access for a one-time purchase of $6 USD or less (depending on your country) and help support my work: [buy early access](https://patreon.kdrag0n.dev/buy/exclusive/inter-font-v3.19.0.zip)

The baseline price is higher than Patreon in order to compensate for the one-time nature of the purchase, but the actual price is lower in most countries due to purchasing power parity adjustments. **You can also buy multiple licenses to share with other individuals** in accordance with the [Terms of Service]({{< relref "terms-of-service" >}}), which applies on a per-license basis.
