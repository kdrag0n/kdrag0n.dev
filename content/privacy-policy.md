This document details how we use your personal information on this website and related properties, services, and applications. Please read it carefully before using our services, along with the [Terms of Service]({{< relref "terms-of-service" >}}). If you do not fully understand and agree to both this document ("Privacy Policy") and the Terms of Service, you may not use any of our services.

We do not sell any personal information, and only collect information as necessary for diagnostic, anti-abuse, functional, debugging, and analytical purposes. Please read the entire agreement carefully for details applicable to each specific property, application, and/or service we provide.

## Main website

This website ([kdrag0n.dev](https://kdrag0n.dev/)) is fully static and does not collect any personal information directly from you. Our web hosting provider, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy), will receive your IP address so that it can serve content.

Additionally, we use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/privacy-policy) to collect anonymous aggregate statistics for the website. This process is fully anonymous and does not track individual users or collect personal information. [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy) is currently used for the same purpose, but it is likely to be removed in the near future.

No cookies are used on this website.

## ProtonAOSP website

The ProtonAOSP website at [protonaosp.kdrag0n.dev](https://protonaosp.kdrag0n.dev) is also a static website hosted on Vercel, with Simple Analytics and GoatCounter for anonymous aggregate statistics.

If you download a build of ProtonAOSP through the web installer, the download will be served by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/), which will receive your IP address so that it can serve the download.

No cookies are used on this website.

## Google Play Store

If you download and install any of our apps from the Google Play Store, the following information will be collected and saved periodically as you use the installed software. The information is stored on a server hosted on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/legal/privacy/) and proxied by Cloudflare.

- Package name of the app
- Version code of the app
- Licensing status reported by the Google Play Store
- Current time and date
- Irreversible hash of a unique device identifier
- User ID reported by the Google Play Store
- IP address
- Whether the user is licensed to use the app

This information is used solely to enforce the [Terms of Service]({{< relref "terms-of-service" >}}), for anti-abuse and debugging purposes.

Additionally, the path and IP address of each request is saved in the server logs for diagnostic, anti-abuse, and debugging purposes. Server logs are purged after 14 days.

## Exclusive content

The exclusive content server at [patreon.kdrag0n.dev](https://patreon.kdrag0n.dev/) is a dynamic application server hosted on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/legal/privacy/) and proxied by Cloudflare.

If you download and install exclusive software from the server, the following information will be collected and saved when you download a file, and a subset of the information will be collected and saved periodically as you use the installed software:

- The ID of the Patreon user, grant link, or purchase that you accessed it with
- Name and checksum of the file you downloaded
- The IP address you downloaded the software from
- When you downloaded the file

Additionally, the following information will be collected and saved periodically as you use the installed software, in association with the information saved on download:

- The IP addresses you use the software from
- Irreversible hash of a unique device identifier
- When the software was last used

This information is used to enforce the [Terms of Service]({{< relref "terms-of-service" >}}), diagnose issues, and calculate aggregate statistics.

When you pledge on Patreon or make a purchase, we will send you a transactional email. Your email address will be sent to our email communications provider, [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/privacy-policy/), in order for us to fulfill your pledge or purchase.

Additionally, the path and IP address of each request is saved in the server logs for diagnostic, anti-abuse, and debugging purposes. Server logs are purged after 14 days.

Additionally, if you proceed to link your Patreon account with the exclusive content server in order to download content, the following information will be saved:

A session cookie will be stored on your device in order to save your login state. No unnecessary cookies are used.

The only information we receive is your email address, which allows us to fulfill your purchase. No payment or billing information is transmitted to our servers.

If you visit a page that includes payments, Stripe may store cookies on your device for fraud detection. No unnecessary cookies are used.
