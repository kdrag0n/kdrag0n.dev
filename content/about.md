Iâ€™m Danny, a hobbyist software developer. The vast majority of my work is free and open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/kdrag0n).

Most of my recent work is related to Android, but I like to dabble with anything related to software: backend, frontend, web, mobile apps, system administration, and more.

Find me on other platforms:

You can reach me via [email](mailto:hi+webabout@kdrag0n.dev) or [Telegram](https://t.me/kdrag0n).

Like my work? Please consider [donating]({{< relref "donate" >}}) so I can keep doing it!
