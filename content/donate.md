Most of my work is free and open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/kdrag0n). By donating, your support will help me keep working on projects for everyone to enjoy freely. Please consider making a donation if you found my work helpful :)

Because updating and maintaining projects takes time continuously, **recurring donations** are the best way to support me and my development. They help me offer **sustainable** support in the long term. If you can’t afford it, that’s okay — you can still support me with a one-time donation. It doesn’t help as much with sustainable support, but all support is appreciated. Don’t worry if you think it’s not enough!

## Recurring

### Patreon (recommended)

The **best way** to support me and my development is by pledging on **[Patreon](https://patreon.com/kdrag0n)**. With a monthly pledge, you’ll get access to many benefits for your support, all the while helping me keep making great things for everyone to enjoy:

- [Early access to updates and new projects](/patreon/)
- Behind-the-scenes development insights
- Polls for updates and features to prioritize
- Priority support

### Liberapay

If you just want to support my development while remaining completely anonymous, you can also start a recurring donation on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com). I can’t offer benefits this way because Liberapay keeps donors fully anonymous, but I appreciate the support!

### PayPal (recurring)

It’s also possible to make a recurring monthly donation with [PayPal Donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=CANAGMNX6YJH6) if you prefer it, but I can’t offer benefits this way either.

## One-time

### PayPal (one-time)

The easiest way for you to make a one-time donation is with [PayPal](https://paypal.me/kdrag0ndonate).

If you don’t have a PayPal account, you can use [PayPal Donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=CANAGMNX6YJH6) to donate directly with a credit or debit card.

### Cryptocurrency

I also accept some cryptocurrencies if you prefer them over other options. Here are the addresses:

```
Bitcoin (BTC): bc1qaculctaahzdkvtn5j5zy7a3d79tg4ytnyf72sg
Ethereum (ETH): 0x8D04A7734fcE8a19f831D049AdBcE22d8CA4ee97
Monero (XMR): 46X8vWfKXKMG6WMLXdhKBvaVtKcPctCtk8kFbmGciAvA4NsqSsVqrVS29BRhtCVB4qGzCkGSLiqN8a9S7TpixF4JQ4qBuWX
```

I recommended using a low fee because donations aren’t time-critical and cryptocurrency fees can get very high for fast transactions.
